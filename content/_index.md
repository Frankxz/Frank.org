I currently work as analyst/developer at [Murphy USA](https://www.murphyusa.com/). I am highly interested in data science/visualization and automated business intelligence solutions. I earned my bachelor's in petroleum engineering and master's in business analytics from [University of Tulsa](https://utulsa.edu/). Therefore I am also passionated about data science and business intelligence applications in oil & gas field.

In the past, I have designed and build automated business intelligence solutions at [FlyingTee Golf](https://www.flyingteegolf.com/) to reduce operations cost and predicte business performance. I also designed and optimized data analytics pipeline for automated processing sequencing data QC at [Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation](https://omrf.org/).

In my spare time, I use Python to gather data from public data sources and R/ggplot2/plotly to plot plenty charts and hopefully find some insights from the data. When I'm in a good mood, I also work on some fancy machine learing and deep learning projects.

I am a gym junkie, I prepare meals, workout almost everyday and enjoy my cheat day on the weekend. I believe in scentific nutrition and sport science papers.

这是谢益辉的个人主页。2013 年底我从 [Ames 村办大学](http://www.iastate.edu)统计系毕业，终于解决了人生前 30 年被问最多的问题：“你怎么还没毕业？”目前就职于 RStudio。我支持开源，喜欢折腾网站和代码，是一个高度自我驱动的人。打羽毛球爱勾对角，打乒乓球像太极，网球满场子捡球，篮球容易被撞飞，攀岩一次，腿软。宅，口重，嗜辣，屡教不改。智商中等偏下，对麻将和三国杀有不可逾越的认知障碍，实变函数课上曾被老师叫醒。略好读书，偶尔也在网上乱翻帖子，对诗词楹联比较感兴趣，目前比较中意的一联是：千秋邈矣独留我；百战归来再读书。最喜欢的一首词是：

> 深情似海，问相逢初度，是何年纪？依约而今还记取，不是前生夙世。放学花前，题诗石上，春水园亭里。逢君一笑，人间无此欢喜。  
> 无奈苍狗看云，红羊数劫，惘惘休提起。客气渐多真气少，汩没心灵何已。千古声名，百年担负，事事违初意。心头阁住，儿时那种情味。
